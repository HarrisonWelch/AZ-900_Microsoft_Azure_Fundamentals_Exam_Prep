# Lecture 28 App Services Containers and Azure Virtual Desktop 

App Services
* A new paradigm for running code in the cloud
* Give your code and configuration to Azure, and they will run it
* Promist of performance but no access to hardware
* Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Integration with GitHub

AB testing with app slots

Can only install provided MS software

## Container Services
* Another Paradigm for running code in the cloud
* Containers contain everything the app needs to run in a "container image"
* Fastest and easiest to deploy
* Azure Container Instance (ACI) - single instance, quickest way to deploy a container
* Azure Container Apps - easy to use like a web service, with advanced features
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - runs on a cluster of servers, enterprise-grade

## Azure Virtual Desktop
* Desktop version of Windows that runs in the cloud
* Your software installed, your files - available from anywhere (phone)
* Can even see your desktop on iOS and Android, or any web browser
* Runs on Azure
