# Cloud Service Types

Aluded  to it in the previous section

Clout service Types
* Iaas (Infrastructure)
* Paas (Plaform)
* Saas (Software)

"As a Service"
* You can rent it for a short time, if you wish
* No commitment, if you wish
  * Start up server whenever, shut it down
  * There are commitment offers if you know - and save money (>50%)
* Pay for what you use (time, GB, or other)
* Cloud provider takes care of buying, developing, and maintaining

Infratructure as a Service
* Essential IT
  * Computing
  * Storage
  * Networking
* Generally have "real world" equivalients in your own data center 
* Cloud replacement of real world things

IaaS Computing
* One example is Azure Virtual Machines
* Pay by the second
  * 3 hours 12 mins 15 secs => all you end up paying for
* Many choices, CPU, RAM, optimization for them (I/O, high compute)

IaaS Storage
* Azure Storage is one example of this
* 5 PB of storage capacity
* Can handle blobs, files, queues, and table
* Can also be configured as a data lake
  * PB, XB

IaaS Networking
* Virtual Networking is an example of this
* VNs don't cost anything
* There are ingress and egress bandwidith costs
  * ingress is free
  * egress, 5GB is free
* And traffic between regions is not free

Platform as a Service
* Cloud service provideres have an opportunity to provide more than just the "basic" infrastructure
* PaaS includes a service layer on top of IaaS - computing, storage, and networking
* Feature functions
* Middleware
* Dev tools, DB servers
* On top of the basic hardware layer

PaaS Computing
* One example is Azure App Services
* Simply upload your code and configuration to Azure, and it runs your code without needing to worry about the VM underneath
* Includes scaling, CI/CD

PaaS Storage
* Managed Storage is an example
* Azure SQL DB is another example
* Freed from worrying about the server VM itself or the hard disk

PaaS Networking
* Azure Front Door is an example of this
* Or Load Balancer
* Or Firewall
* These are software apps that provide networking tasks

Software as a Service (Saas)
* Cloud apps
* Tools such as Office 365, OneDrive, Skype
* The app is ready to be used and you simply need to set it up and use it
