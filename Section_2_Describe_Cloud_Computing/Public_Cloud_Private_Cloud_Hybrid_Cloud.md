## Public Cloud

The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by 3rd party providers over the public internet, making them available to anyone who wants to purchase or use them.

In this case
* Azure hosts them and makes them available to purchase
* 90% we are talking about Azure in place of Public Cloud

## Private Cloud

This is such a thing

Computing services offered either opver the internet or private internal network and only to select users instead of general public

Example:
* Government Cloud

Looks and acts like a cloud, except customer owns or leases or has exclusive access to the hardware

"Stack HCI" to rent and use on own hardware - MS

## Hybrid Cloud

Mixure of Public and Private

Computing env that combines a private cloud and public cloud

Stretch DB Example:
* Local DB can scale out to public cloud to get addition storage space, usually for cold storage
* This is deprecated but added in SQL server 2016

Pub vs Priv vs Hybrid
* Pub is Azure, includes some licensing
* Private - loaned or leased or owned
* Best of both worlds - Public cloud for non-critical data, extending resources
