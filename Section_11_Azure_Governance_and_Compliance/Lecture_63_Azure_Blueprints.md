Azure Subscription templates with Roles and Policies already defined

Blueprints predefine a number of items
* Resource groups 
* ARM templates
* Policy definitions
* Role based access control

You can assign permissions which "allow"s them to use something. Blueprints can elect to deny a resource permissions. Cannot be overriden.
